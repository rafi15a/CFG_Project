            <p> Code First Girls is a Not for Profit Social Enterprise that trains women in IT skills <br>
            and helps companies to develop more female‑friendly recruitment policies.<br>
            The organisation promotes gender diversity and female participation in the technology sector,<br>
            by offering free and paid training and courses for students and professional women.<br>
            It also supports businesses to train staff and develop talent management policies.<br>
            <br>
            Code First Girls began in late 2012 as "a nine-week, free, part-time course<br> 
            to get female graduates from all walks of life not only interested in coding,<br> 
            but also better equipped to contribute to technical discussions in high-tech businesses".<br>
            <br>
            Founded by Alice Bentinck and Matthew Clifford, they recognised a lack of female applications <br>
            for their pre-seed investment programme Entrepreneur First (EF). So, Code First: Girls was created  <br>
            <br>
            Code First: Girls was included in the UK Government's "UK Digital Strategy" policy paper 2017 <br>
            as a "programmes doing valuable and innovative work to help more women into tech". <br>
