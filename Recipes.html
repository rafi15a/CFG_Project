                <p>“This is a hearty, delicious alternative to traditional chilli con carne,<br>
                    that can be tweaked depending on what you have. <br>
                    Use butternut squash or regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes. <br>
                    No onions? Try using a leek or a few spring onions.  <br>
                    Also, you can use fresh basil in place of coriander, or leave the herbs out altogether. ” <br> </p>

                <p>When the pumpkin season hits, recipes of pumpkin main-course and dessert are flooded online.<br> 
                    I also got hold of a big pumpkin from the market and used it for a few rounds of this Pumpkin Rice <br>
                    and puree the balance and freeze it for dessert recipes.<br></p>

                <p>Full of life and colour, these beautiful vegan ‘stained glass’ rolls are a real celebration of amazing veg.<br> 
                    You can prep the dips, pickle and veg in advance, but fry your tempura just before eating to keep it crisp. <br>
                    Insanely good!<br></p>

                    Link to recipe</a>
                <p>This is a fantastic dish from southern Italy that's eaten as a warm vegetable side dish or a cold antipasto. <br>
                    Sicilians are proud that it's made with produce from their island. <br>
                    All the different methods of making it are more or less the same <br>
                    The things that make it stand out and be special are the quality of the aubergines, tomatoes and vinegar. <br>

                <p>So Christmas is coming round the corner and for those of you who were unsure on what to cook, <br>
                why not swap the turkey for curry? <br>
                It may be a radical idea, however its a change and it would quite literally spice things up!<br>
                I have selected Jamie Oliver’s Christmas Curry recipe because it is simple and easy to follow!<br></p>
